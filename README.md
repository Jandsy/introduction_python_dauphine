## Instructor

* Jeremy Chichportich

## Getting Started
* The scripts are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google Colab.
* For those who'd like to execute the scripts locally, consider using Jupyter Notebook. Check out this [tutorial](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on how to install Jupyter through Anaconda for detailed guidance.

## Module Outline Information

### Module Description
The module is structured around 4 sessions of 3 hours each. The sessions are comprised of practical implementation sessions. Students will be expected to devote an equivalent amount of learning time outside of class, in private and group study of module material. Teaching format will employ Python.


### Learning Outcomes 

The objectives of this module are:
* Grasp foundational Python programming concepts, including variables, data types, and the print() function.
* Master the use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control program flow based on specific conditions. 
* Understand the concept and importance of libraries and modules in Python, introducing primary tools like Numpy and Pandas.
* Acquire proficiency in using Numpy for numerical operations and Pandas for structured data exploration, manipulation, and analysis.
* Develop the skills to create and customize data visualizations using Matplotlib, showcasing insights from datasets.
* Introduce yfinance to fetch and analyze stock market data, integrating its functionality with Pandas and Matplotlib for comprehensive financial analysis.


## Assessment 

* Participation : 30%
* Exam : 70%
