Welcome to you all !

This [GitHub Home page] contains all the materials for the course **Introduction to Python for Finance 2022** at Universit√© Paris Dauphine.

## Instructor

* Jeremy Chichportich

## Getting Started
* The scripts are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google Colab.
* For those who'd like to execute the scripts locally, consider using Jupyter Notebook. Check out this [tutorial](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) on how to install Jupyter through Anaconda for detailed guidance.

## Module Outline Information

### Module Description
The module is structured around 4 sessions of 3 hours each. The sessions are comprised of practical implementation sessions. Students will be expected to devote an equivalent amount of learning time outside of class, in private and group study of module material. Teaching format will employ Python.

### Module Aims & Objectives
The module will introduce the main subareas of Python in order to tackle various problem tasks.   

### Learning Outcomes 

The objectives of this module are:
* Develop knowledge on the roadmap for building machine learning systems.
* Get familiar with traditional Machine Learning algorithms and more advanced techniques including Deep Learning. 
* Get a good understanding of the basic concepts of Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Sequence Models.
* Develop skills to process sequential data, especially in the context of Natural Language Processing. 
* Practice supervised learning by predicting loan default risk.
* Practice sentiment analysis with state-of-the-art algorithms for sequential data.
